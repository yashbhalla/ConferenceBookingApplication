# Conference Booking Application

Welcome to the Conference Booking Application! This project, developed using GoLang, serves as an educational endeavor to enhance proficiency in Go programming. By engaging with various fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, error handling, and concurrency, this application provides a comprehensive learning experience for both beginners and intermediate developers.

## Overview

The Conference Booking Application facilitates the booking of tickets for conferences. Users can conveniently reserve tickets by providing their first name, last name, email ID, and the desired number of tickets. Each user has the flexibility to book multiple tickets, up to a maximum limit of 50 tickets per transaction.

## Features

- User-Friendly Interface: The application offers a straightforward interface for users to input their booking details.
- Validation Checks: Robust validation ensures that email IDs end with ".com" and that the number of tickets is of integer type only.
- Email Confirmation: Upon successful booking, users receive a simulated email confirmation within the terminal, providing a real-time use case scenario.
- Concurrency: Leveraging Go's concurrency features, the application efficiently handles multiple booking requests concurrently, ensuring smooth operation even during peak times.
